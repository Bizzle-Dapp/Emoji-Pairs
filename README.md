## Emoji Pairs Game

A little game I made for my daughter during the Covid-19 Lockdown. She was moaning that she was bored, so I went out the office in the morning, and returned with this in the afternoon - just before bedtime. She can play it tomorrow though, right..?

## NOW WITH THREE WHOLE DIFFICULTY LEVELS!

Mindblowing paired madness awaits in the challenges ahead. With the power of Knuth Shuffle, *no two games are the same!!!

*(Games can in fact be the same as a previous one. How many different variations of cards is subject to the difficulty ratings, but it's not a mindblowing amount of variation.)
